# My Personal Corona Tracker

With the rising case rates (and we as we head into the winter), I decided to start paying closer attention to who I was seeing, where I was going, how often I was geting tested,
and how my general area was doing. 


I created [a coronavirus tracker](https://svannie678.github.io/my_personal_corona_tracker/#my-stats) to hold myself accountable, and to be able to share information
easily with friends and family. 

The NYC health data comes directly from the [NYC DOH github repo](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data), which is updated daily. 

I hope you enjoy -- and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
